I need to build the data. to see how these look. I ran the data with two versions one with sonobatv420 and the other with sonobatv4.4.5. this would be a good moment to compare them but I predict that they are going to be different.\
I have realized that a good way to analyze the data is to take in consideration the column X.Spp and the column X.Prob to to increase the data we have, then when cleaning the data we merge that one with the SppAccp and then we have more data.
