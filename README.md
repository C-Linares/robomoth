# Robomoth

Here we start exploring and analyzing the data collected with robomoths and recording at the pioneer lights study

I need to build the data. to see how these look. I ran the data with two versions one with Sonobatv420 and the other with Sonobatv4.4.5. this would be a good moment to compare them, but I predict that they will be different.\
I have realized that a good way to analyze the data is to take in consideration the column X.Spp and the column X.Prob to to increase the data we have, then when cleaning the data we merge that one with the SppAccp and then we have more data.

I created a database for Robomoths deployed with SM4 in 2021. I want to compare the number of species and number of calls detected between Sonobat versions.

There is an error with the sonobatv4.4.5 that makes the data move and show in column where it does not belong.\

I started counting buzzes at sites. It seems like there's some problems with the recordings. The sound of the robo-moth masks sometimes the calls
